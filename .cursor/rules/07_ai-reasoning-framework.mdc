## Chain-of-Thought (CoT) - Problem Decomposition

When approaching tasks, break them down systematically:

### Simple Tasks (Quick CoT)
- "Need to create API endpoint → Define route → Implement handler → Add tests → Done"

### Complex Tasks (Full CoT)
1. **Decompose**: Split into smaller, manageable components
2. **Sequential Logic**: Show clear progression from problem → solution
3. **Explicit Reasoning**: Articulate WHY each step is necessary
4. **Intermediate Steps**: Don't jump to conclusions; show the work

**Example:**
```
To implement authentication:
1. Create User entity and DbContext (Foundation)
2. Implement password hashing service (Security)
3. Create JWT token generator (Authentication)
4. Build register/login endpoints (API)
5. Add integration tests (Validation)
```

## ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) - Iterative Development

Use this six-phase cycle for complex implementations:

### 1. OBSERVE 🔍
- Current state: What exists now?
- User request: What is being asked?
- Context: What's the broader situation?
- Constraints: What limitations exist?

### 2. ANALYZE 🧠
- Root cause: Why does this issue exist?
- Dependencies: What else is affected?
- Implications: What are the consequences?
- Alternatives: What other approaches exist?

### 3. PLAN 📋
- Step-by-step approach with clear milestones
- Verification points at each step
- Rollback strategy if issues arise
- Resource requirements (tools, packages, configurations)

### 4. ACT ⚡
- Execute with incremental changes, not big bangs
- Use existing patterns before creating new ones
- Make changes systematically
- Document as you go

### 5. VERIFY ✅
- Check results against expected outcomes
- Run validation (build, tests, lint)
- Update documentation
- Test edge cases

### 6. REFLECT 🤔
- What worked well?
- What could be improved?
- What patterns emerged?
- Update instructions based on learnings

## System 2 Reasoning - Deliberate Analysis

Engage deep analytical thinking for complex decisions:

### Five Key Practices
1. **Question Assumptions**: Don't accept requirements at face value
2. **Consider Trade-offs**: Every decision has pros and cons
3. **Think Long-term**: How will this affect future work?
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Have we solved similar problems before?
5. **Meta-cognition**: Monitor your own reasoning process

### Red Flags Requiring Deep Analysis
- ⚠️ Architectural changes (affects multiple services)
- ⚠️ Security implementations (authentication, authorization)
- ⚠️ Performance optimizations (caching, database queries)
- ⚠️ New patterns (precedent-setting decisions)
- ⚠️ Breaking changes (API contracts, database schema)

## Application Guidelines

### For Simple Tasks
- Quick CoT: "Need X → Create Y → Test Z → Done"
- Single OBSERVE → ACT cycle

### For Complex Tasks
- Full ReAct cycle required
- Multiple iterations through all six phases
- Deep System 2 reasoning for critical decisions
- Document reasoning in commit messages

### When Mistakes Occur
1. **Acknowledge**: "You're right, I missed X"
2. **Root Cause**: "This happened because..."
3. **Immediate Fix**: Correct the issue
4. **Prevention**: "Adding [check/validation] to prevent recurrence"
5. **Learn**: Update patterns and instructions

## Remember

- **Apply CoT/ReAct/Reasoning** for all complex tasks to ensure systematic, thoughtful implementation
- Follow the ReAct cycle for complex tasks
- Apply CoT reasoning for problem decomposition
- Use System 2 reasoning for critical architectural decisions
